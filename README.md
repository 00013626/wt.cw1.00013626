I have created a website that is located in my hometown, named Everbest education center. Currently, They have no their own proper website. My website consists of 6 pages,namely "Home", "About", "Our Team", "Online lessons", "FAQ" and "Contacts" sections. In the development of my website I have used HTML,CSS and Javascript for formatting and designing it. Furthermore, I have used only one CSS stylesheet named "Homepage.css" and 6 type of HTML stylesheets for HTML pages.In addition, in website, all related texts,logo and picters are included.I have tried to show and describe the real version of my education center that teachers and picture in the "About" section are the real ones that Teachers really works in there.As it is a website for education, I have tried to include sections which is every education websites are needed.I have styled stylesheets as possible as I can and I also tried to use some Javascript codes to add more design and fuctions, for example, in the homepage, why we section, cards will be shown in slow motion. Though, some buttons namely, some buttons do not work as it requires back-end sessions, as an example, "watch" button where you can not watch video but at least I have tried to make it clickable.In the end I could do only homepage section responsive.
